# Architecture Decision Records

Short records of decisions that future engineers (or Claude Code) might otherwise revisit
repeatedly. Each ADR states **Context, Decision, Alternatives Considered, Consequences,**
and **Status**.

Per the [Constitution](../CONSTITUTION.md), an invariant changes **only** through an ADR —
never silently in a feature PR. Introducing a new infrastructure dependency, cloud service,
queue, database, or framework requires a new ADR first.

## How to add an ADR

1. Copy [`000-template.md`](./000-template.md) to `NNN-short-title.md` (next number).
2. Fill in every section.
3. Set **Status** to `Proposed`; move to `Accepted` after review (or `Superseded by
   ADR-NNN` when replaced).
