 * Authorization matrix for the People & Households domain (BLUEPRINT §34 "what action?

 * Tenant scope ("which data?") is enforced independently by the tenant guard, which
 * refuses any Person/Household query without an organizationId.
 *
 * Person contact and household data is classified Confidential (BLUEPRINT §63) and is a
 * distinct security domain from content management -- so CONTENT_MANAGER,
 * ANALYTICS_VIEWER, and PRAYER_MODERATOR get no access. Kept deliberately small and
 * declarative so the negative cases are obvious and testable.
